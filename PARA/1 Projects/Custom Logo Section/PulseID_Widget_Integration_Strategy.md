## ðŸ§­ What Most PulseID Customers Do for Custom Widgets

### ðŸ¥‡ Most Common Approach: Hosted & Script-Injected Widget

Most mid to large e-commerce brands:
- Build the widget using React, Vue, or plain JavaScript.
- Host it externally (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, AWS S3, Firebase).
- Embed it on a BigCommerce page using a `<script>` tag with a placeholder div.
- Dynamically inject HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from the external script.
- Optionally pass product data using query parameters or `data-` attributes.

**Why?**  
It keeps BigCommerce lean, allows for rapid development and deployment, and supports complex front-end logic without requiring theme uploads.

### ðŸ¥ˆ Second Most Common: iframe-Based Integration

- The widget is hosted externally and embedded in an iframe like:
  ```html
  <iframe src="https://hosted-app/widget.html" ...></iframe>
  ```
- Great for sandboxing styles and logic.

**Ideal for:** Simpler tools or when CSS/JS isolation is critical.

---

### ðŸ¥‰ Less Common: Self-Contained Inline HTML

- All widget code (HTML + JS) is pasted directly into a BigCommerce Web Page or product description.

**Drawbacks:**
- No version control
- Difficult to maintain
- Doesnâ€™t scale well

## âœ… What PulseID Does Themselves

PulseIDâ€™s Free Form and Template Designer widgets:
- Are **hosted by PulseID**
- Embedded via `<script>` tags with configuration via `data-` attributes
- Dynamically inject UI into designated DOM elements

This is the **hosted widget + dynamic script injection** pattern.

## ðŸ’¡ Recommended Strategy (Your Case)

Given your experience and setup:

> âœ… **Recommended:** Hosted on Netlify + Embedded via `<script>` or `<iframe>`

**Benefits:**
- Full control and flexibility
- Version controlled and separately deployed
- Easier integration with PulseID APIs or your proxy
- No need to re-upload your BigCommerce theme for widget changes
