Here is what ChatGPT said after getting changes from it.

-------------

## Changes to App.module.css:

Done! I updated App.module.css to use RockBottomGolf branding:

- Added Google Font import for **Mulish** and a :root block with brand variables (--rbg-primary #01415c, neutrals, and accents).
    
- Swapped the app’s **font-family** to Mulish and standardized text color to var(--rbg-dark).
    
- Updated buttons (font/color buttons and toggles), drawers, and floating controls to use brand borders, hover/focus states, shadows, and a primary top border.
    
- Cleaned up fontButtonRow (ensures display: flex;) and aligned gaps/centering.
    
- Set consistent white backgrounds where appropriate and light gray app background.
    
- Made selected states use the **primary blue** instead of black/gray.
    

  
## Changes to App.jsx

Patch applied to App.jsx:

- Removed the stray <user__selection></user__selection> fragment in FontSelector.
    
- Styled the text label via styles.textLabel for brand consistency.
    
- Replaced the mobile “Select Color” <strong> block with the same labeled pattern used on desktop (colorLabel + non-bold selectedColorName).
