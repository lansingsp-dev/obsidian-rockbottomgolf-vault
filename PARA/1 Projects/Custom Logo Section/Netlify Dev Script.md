---

## üí° Important Notes

- **Use this URL in the browser:**
  ```
  http://localhost:8888
  ```

- **Do NOT use the Vite-only port (`5173`)**, as it cannot route to Netlify functions.

- **Your fetch should look like this:**
  ```js
  fetch('/.netlify/functions/pulseid-proxy?endpoint=Template/GetTemplates&variantId=...')
  ```

---

## üõ† Optional Enhancement

To auto-open the correct Netlify port in your browser, update `start-netlify.sh` like this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
source "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"

nvm use 20.19.4
netlify dev --open
```
