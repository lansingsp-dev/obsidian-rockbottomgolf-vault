## 🔧 Toggling Cloud-Based AI Suggestions in WebStorm

To manage **cloud-based AI suggestions** in WebStorm:

---

### ✅ Step 1: Open AI Assistant Settings
- Navigate to: `Preferences` → `Tools` → `AI Assistant`.
- This section controls the AI Assistant features, including cloud usage.

---

### ✅ Step 2: Manage Cloud Access
- Look for the option:

- Toggle this setting:
- ✅ **Enable**: Get completions and chat from JetBrains’ cloud models (e.g., Mellum, OpenAI).
- ❌ **Disable**: Restrict all AI features to **local-only** processing.

---

### ✅ Step 3: Sign In (if not already)
- If you enable cloud suggestions, you’ll be prompted to:
- Sign in with your **JetBrains account**.
- Accept JetBrains AI **Terms of Service** and data usage agreements.

### 🔒 Privacy Tip
If you're working with **sensitive or proprietary code**, and want to keep everything **local**:
- Leave **cloud-based suggestions disabled**.
- Rely only on **local full-line completion**, which runs entirely on your machine.
