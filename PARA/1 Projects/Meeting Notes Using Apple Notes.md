# 🧠 How to Keep Weekly Meeting Context in Apple Notes

This guide shows how to track weekly meeting notes in Apple Notes using structure, tagging, and internal linking — all compatible with Apple’s built-in features.

---

## ✅ 1. Use a Consistent Title Format

**Use a clear, date-based naming convention:**
Weekly Status Call - 2025-07-17
Weekly Status Call - 2025-07-24

This ensures notes are:
- Easy to sort
- Easy to search
- Easy to reference in the future

---

## ✅ 2. Create a Dedicated Folder

**Create a folder in Apple Notes named:**
Weekly Meetings

Optionally organize by team or topic:
- Engineering Syncs
- Marketing Updates
- Project X Calls

---

## ✅ 3. Use Tags for Grouping

**Apple Notes supports hashtags. Add relevant tags at the bottom of your note like:**
`#statuscall #projectX #weeklymeeting`

This allows:
- Quick filtering
- Grouping related notes over time
- Easy search in the Notes app

---

## ✅ 4. Link to Previous Notes for Continuity

Since **macOS Ventura / iOS 17**, Apple Notes supports internal note links.
### To link to a previous meeting:
1. Right-click on the previous note
2. Select **Copy Note Link**
3. Paste into the current note like:

🔗 Previous: Weekly Status Call – 2025-07-10

This creates a **manual thread of linked weekly notes**.

---

## ✅ 5. Use a Reusable Weekly Meeting Template

Here’s a template to use inside each note:

```markdown
# Weekly Status Call – 2025-07-17

🔗 Previous: Weekly Status Call – 2025-07-10
