# üß© BigCommerce + NetSuite + ChannelAdvisor + Nextopia Integration Overview

This document outlines how the core systems‚Äî**BigCommerce**, **NetSuite**, **ChannelAdvisor**, and **Nextopia (Searchspring)**‚Äîwork together in a modern e-commerce stack.

---

## üõçÔ∏è BigCommerce

**Role:** Customer-facing storefront  
BigCommerce serves as the **presentation and transaction layer**. It handles:

- Product catalog display
- Customer browsing experience
- Cart and checkout
- Order creation

BigCommerce is primarily driven by **data pushed in from upstream systems**.

---

## üì¶ ChannelAdvisor

**Role:** Multi-channel syndication and product/inventory hub  
ChannelAdvisor is used to:

- Syndicate product data to BigCommerce, Amazon, eBay, Walmart, etc.
- Control pricing, availability, and promotions
- Centralize inventory feeds from NetSuite
- Route orders to ERP systems (like NetSuite)

BigCommerce is configured as a **"Webstore" channel** inside ChannelAdvisor.

---

## üßæ Oracle NetSuite

**Role:** ERP and back-office system of record  
NetSuite is the **source of truth** for:

- Product master data
- Inventory levels
- Orders and fulfillment
- Financials and accounting

**Integration to ChannelAdvisor or BigCommerce** is typically done through:
- Celigo
- FarApp
- Dell Boomi
- Or custom RESTlets via SuiteScript

---

## üîç Nextopia (Searchspring)

**Role:** On-site search, dynamic merchandising, and product grid injection  
Nextopia replaces or enhances BigCommerce's native:

- Search autocomplete
- Category filtering
- Product list rendering
- Merchandising campaigns (e.g., banners, boost rules)

It loads via a JavaScript snippet and often **replaces the native product grid with dynamic content** based on search and merchandising rules.

## üß† Tips for Managing the Stack

- **Product master data** should originate from NetSuite or ChannelAdvisor‚Äîavoid editing manually in BigCommerce.
- Ensure each system has a clear boundary: BigCommerce for UI, ChannelAdvisor for channels, NetSuite for operations, Nextopia for frontend search/UX.
- Use **staging environments** for each component if possible to avoid conflicts (especially with hardcoded domains in Nextopia scripts).

---

## üß∞ Optional Enhancements

- Use **Google Tag Manager** to track performance of Nextopia campaigns.
- Sync **custom fields** from NetSuite ‚Üí ChannelAdvisor ‚Üí BigCommerce for advanced filtering.
- Use **relative URLs** in Nextopia/Searchspring to prevent production links on staging.
