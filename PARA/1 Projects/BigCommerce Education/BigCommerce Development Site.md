- Navigate to where Kevin went for Stencil CLI - `Storefront > Stencil > Stencil CLI`
- Stencil uses SCSS (Sassy CSS) for a CSS pre-processor to nest CSS properties, variables and mix-ins.
- Handlebars is similar to JSP pages but is javascript based instead of java and has very limited ability for logic (no loops with conditions).
- Â npm install -g @bigcommerce/stencil-cli
