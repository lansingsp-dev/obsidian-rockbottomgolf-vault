- So RBG is using the Stencil -> Cornerstone theme ?
	- A fully hosted, traditional BigCommerce storefront
	- A quick time to market using theme-based development
	- Built-in performance optimization without extra configuration
	- Easier maintenance without managing external hosting
- Stencil CLI - Is this sandbox you were referring to which is nice but does not have production data like the ThemeBridge does?
- Where is the codebase kept? Can I get this codebase to get running using Stencil CLI locally and preview?
	- I was able to download RBG theme from the BigCommerce Rock Bottom Account

	- The issue is is getting Stencil CLI token to retrieve the actual data from BigCommerce.
