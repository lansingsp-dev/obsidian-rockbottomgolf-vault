Run from the home directory of the theme

1. **Reads package.json:**
    
    It looks at the dependencies and devDependencies sections to determine what packages are required.
    
2. **Installs packages:**
    
    It downloads those packages (and their dependencies) from the [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com) into a `node_modules` directory in your project.
    
3. **Creates/updates package-lock.json:**
    
    This file records the exact version of each package installed to ensure consistency across environments.
