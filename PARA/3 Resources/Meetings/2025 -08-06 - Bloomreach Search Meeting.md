Here’s a crisp recap of the meeting.

  

# **Purpose**

  

Evaluate Bloomreach’s search solution using data collected from a pixel on the site, estimate revenue lift, and discuss how it would coexist with current redirects/landing pages and auto-suggest behavior.

  

# **What Bloomreach Did**

- Deployed a pixel for ~40 days to observe user searches, clicks, add-to-carts, and purchases.
    
- Analyzed ~200+ unique on-site queries.
    
- Modeled how re-ranking results (pushing top performers higher) could impact revenue.
    

  

# **Key Findings & Claims**

- **Projected incremental revenue lift:** ~**10–21%** overall.
    
    - Brand search improvement: **~10–13%+**
        
    - Category improvement: **~6–8%**
        
    
- **Query mix (examples):** trending terms from promos (e.g., “warehouse sale”), exact SKU/model queries (e.g., “QI10”), non-product queries (~5%), feature queries (e.g., “left handed”), misspellings, and broad brand/type terms.
    
- **Synonyms & spelling correction:** System learns equivalences (e.g., “QI10” ↔ “TaylorMade QI10”; “Bridg Stow” → “Bridgestone”) and reduces zero-result searches.
    
- **Auto-suggest:** Can rank terms, products, and categories based on interaction and purchase frequency; priorities adapt over time.
    
- **Relevance vs. current results:** In several examples, Bloomreach said it would surface top-performing/brand-relevant items first, reducing cases where high performers fall below the fold.
    

  

# **Concerns Raised by RBG (Important)**

- **Redirect mismatch:** Team noted several example queries (e.g., “Snake Eyes,” “left handed”) currently **redirect to appropriate brand/left-handed pages**, while the deck showed “competitor/alternative” results.
    
    → Worry: the lift assessment may be comparing against scenarios that **don’t match** live behavior.
    
- **“Empty/blank” searches:** Bloomreach reported >50% of traffic issuing empty queries; RBG believes no-result rate is **<1%**. Needs reconciliation (could be how the pixel interprets submissions).
    
- **Campaign-driven queries:** Some observed terms are generated by RBG’s dynamic links (email/newsletter) that point directly to search; want clarity on how Bloomreach treats these and preserves intended landing experiences.
    

  

# **Platform/Capability Notes**

- Ranking rules and redirects can be configured per term.
    
- Can redirect to categories with referrers and maintain custom product ordering/banners.
    
- System can A/B test **redirected landing page** vs **plain search results** to measure revenue impact.
    

  

# **Decisions & Next Steps**

- **Follow-up:** Vendor will investigate the discrepancies (redirect behavior vs. examples shown; “empty query” volume) and report back.
    
- **Access:** Bloomreach to provide dashboard access (limited catalog—pixel-scraped products only) and schedule a quick “crash course.”
    
- **Session scheduled:** **Friday the 8th at 10:30 AM Eastern (9:30 AM Central).**
    
- **RBG ask:** Ensure the **lift model compares apples-to-apples** with current live redirects/landing pages and promo flows before socializing ROI internally.
    

  

# **Open Questions**

1. Why did the pixel record cases that conflict with live redirects (e.g., “Snake Eyes,” “left handed”)? Is the pixel logging pre-redirect states?
    
2. What’s the true share of “blank/empty” searches? Are analytics filtering these out differently than the pixel?
    
3. How does Bloomreach guarantee that **keyword-tied landing pages with banners/order** remain the default experience when desired?
    
4. Will synonym/spell-correction ever override intentional campaign routing? How is precedence managed?
    
5. What exact data set (products/attributes) fuels the current dashboard so RBG can test rules meaningfully?
    

  

# **Quick Wins (suggested)**

- If “empty query” submissions are real: add a small JS guard to **block blank searches** to save API calls.
    
- Prepare an A/B plan for 1–2 high-volume terms (e.g., a brand and a category) to test **redirect vs. ranked results** with revenue as the primary KPI.
    

  

If you want, I can turn this into an Obsidian-ready note or a one-pager for management.
