	- Fooling around with the pulseID widget and trying to get to experiment with in my local instance of stencil. 
		- We are currently using the Freeform Designer and trying to get access to using the Template Designer for testing.
		- I think we will also need access from PulseID to API access to prototype some code.
	- Need to see if the demo site works if I package a them and upload. Do you think Rock Bottom Golf Demo is registered with pulseID?
