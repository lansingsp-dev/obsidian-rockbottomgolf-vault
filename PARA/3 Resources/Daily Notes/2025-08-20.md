Turns out they moved where to download themes. Here is the new way to navigate to a theme
- Select Channels from sidebar navigation
- Select Edit theme button for the current theme.
- This will take you to the Page Builder. In the upper left hand corner select Return to Control Panel.
- Select Discard Changes
- You then see items in the sidebar navigation under Channels where Themes should be selected.
- Advanced -> Download Current Theme.
